			<div><h3 class="review-section">Article 1 - Privacy Policy jurisdiction and definitions</h3>
<div >This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of France and the European Union regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - EU Regulation 2016/679), and will be interpreted in accordance with the French courts. You can get on this page, for your reading comfort and understanding, a full translation in English of the Privacy Policy of the current mobile application.<br />
<br />
The below listed words define :<br />
<br />
- 'Mobile application', 'mobile app' or 'app' : the mobile application Credit Card Reader NFC (EMV) and all its screens.<br />
- 'Publisher' : Julien MILLAU, the legal or natural person responsible for editing and publishing content on the app.<br />
- 'User' : the person using the app.</div></div>

<div><h3 class="review-section">Article 2 - Introduction and role of the current document</h3>
<div >This privacy policy informs you of the commitments the app publisher is taking in order to respect your privacy and protect the personal data collected and processed when using the app, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - EU Regulation 2016/679).<br />
<br />
This app does not require any user registration or account creation.<br />
<br />
You may at any time contact the app publisher at this address : android@julien-millau.fr for any question related to this privacy policy or to exercise your rights.<br />
<br />
However, since the app does not have internet access, it does not transmit any data (NFC reading, analytics or other) to external servers. The publisher is therefore not able to action certain requests due to the lack of information enabling direct identification.</div></div>

<div><h3 class="review-section">Article 3 - Data controller</h3>
<div >The data controller is Julien MILLAU, Auto entrepreneur, publisher of the app Credit Card Reader NFC (EMV).<br />
<br />
Contact : android@julien-millau.fr.</div></div>

<div><h3 class="review-section">Article 4 - Data collection</h3>
<div >This app does not require any account creation or user registration. No personal data is collected through forms or registration processes.<br />
<br />
All NFC card data read by the app is stored exclusively on the user's device (locally). No data is transmitted to any external server.<br />
<br />
The app does not have any internet access permission. Therefore, it does not transmit any data and does not use any third-party services (advertising, analytics, etc.).</div></div>

<div><h3 class="review-section">Article 5 - Legal basis for data processing</h3>
<div >In accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR, the legal basis for the processing of data within this app is the legitimate interest of the publisher (Article 6.1.f of the GDPR). The local storage of NFC card data on the user's device is necessary for the app to fulfill its core functionality, which is to read and display public data from NFC banking cards compliant with the EMV norm.</div></div>

<div><h3 class="review-section">Article 6 - Collection purposes</h3>
<div >The data read from NFC banking cards is stored locally on the user's device for the sole purpose of allowing the user to consult the public information read from the card within the app.</div></div>

<div><h3 class="review-section">Article 7 - User rights</h3>
<div >In accordance with the GDPR (Articles 15 to 22), you have the following rights regarding your personal data :<br />
<br />
- Right of access (Article 15) : you have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed, and to access such data.<br />
- Right to rectification (Article 16) : you have the right to obtain rectification of inaccurate personal data.<br />
- Right to erasure (Article 17) : you have the right to obtain the erasure of your personal data. Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete it at any time by clearing the app data or uninstalling the app.<br />
- Right to restriction of processing (Article 18) : you have the right to obtain restriction of processing in certain circumstances.<br />
- Right to data portability (Article 20) : you have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.<br />
- Right to object (Article 21) : you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data.<br />
<br />
To exercise any of these rights, you may contact the publisher at the following address : android@julien-millau.fr.<br />
<br />
The app does not use any third-party services and does not have internet access, so no advertising identifiers (AAID) are processed by the publisher.<br />
<br />
In accordance with the applicable regulations, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the French data protection authority (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés - CNIL) if you consider that your rights have not been respected. The CNIL can be reached at : www.cnil.fr.</div></div>

<div><h3 class="review-section">Article 8 - Data security</h3>
<div >All data read by the app is stored exclusively on the user's device. The publisher does not have access to this data.<br />
<br />
The user is solely responsible for the security of his or her device. All data stored by the application is under the user's own responsibility. The publisher recommends that users protect their device with appropriate security measures (screen lock, encryption, etc.).</div></div>

<div><h3 class="review-section">Article 9 - Data storage duration</h3>
<div >All data read by the app is stored locally on the user's device. This data is retained until the user deletes the app or clears the app data from the device settings. The publisher does not retain any user data on external servers.</div></div>
